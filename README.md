## Hi there 👋

I'm **Jose**, an iOS app developer based in **Mexico**.  
I design and build whatever I can imagine.  
If an idea pops into my head, chances are I’ll build it and share it.

My main tech stack includes **Swift**, **SwiftUI**, and **SQLite**.  
My favorite tools are **Figma**, **Xcode**, **Apple Notes**, **Notion**, and **Playgrounds** on my iPad.

I'm currently studying **Swift** with **SwiftUI**, and I’ve built three apps so far.  
You can find some of them pinned below — my favorite right now is **[BetterRest](https://github.com/peralta8086/BetterRestApp)** 💤,  
an app that uses **machine learning** to predict the ideal bedtime based on your sleep habits.  
Right after that comes **[Guess The Flag](https://github.com/Peralta24/GuessTheFlag)** 🏳️, which was a super fun project to practice SwiftUI basics.

I’ve created over **5 public repositories**, and privately… probably more than **10** at this point.  
If you’d like to see my projects, they’re available here on my GitHub profile.
